Hint
You are given a string s of length m consisting of digits. You are also given a 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].

For each queries[i], extract the substring s[li..ri]. Then, perform the following:

Form a new integer x by concatenating all the non-zero digits from the substring in their original order. If there are no non-zero digits, x = 0.
Let sum be the sum of digits in x. The answer is x * sum.
Return an array of integers answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Since the answers may be very large, return them modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "10203004", queries = [[0,7],[1,3],[4,6]]

Output: [12340, 4, 9]

Explanation:

s[0..7] = "10203004"
x = 1234
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
Therefore, answer is 1234 * 10 = 12340.
s[1..3] = "020"
x = 2
sum = 2
Therefore, the answer is 2 * 2 = 4.
s[4..6] = "300"
x = 3
sum = 3
Therefore, the answer is 3 * 3 = 9.
Example 2:

Input: s = "1000", queries = [[0,3],[1,1]]

Output: [1, 0]

Explanation:

s[0..3] = "1000"
x = 1
sum = 1
Therefore, the answer is 1 * 1 = 1.
s[1..1] = "0"
x = 0
sum = 0
Therefore, the answer is 0 * 0 = 0.
Example 3:

Input: s = "9876543210", queries = [[0,9]]

Output: [444444137]

Explanation:

s[0..9] = "9876543210"
x = 987654321
sum = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45
Therefore, the answer is 987654321 * 45 = 44444444445.
We return 44444444445 modulo (109 + 7) = 444444137."""
